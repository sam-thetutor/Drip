This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]."

This can be worked around by making those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry points to them.
