## 🎯 Pitch Deck

### The Problem

**Creators, collectives, and service platforms struggle to automate continuous payouts or usage-based billing.**

- **Treasury managers waste hours** reconciling spreadsheets and processing manual bulk transfers
- **Contributors wait** for delayed manual payments, creating cash flow issues
- **Legacy payroll systems** are expensive across borders and lack transparency or programmable logic
- **No real-time payment streaming** - payments are batch-based, not continuous
- **Recurring subscriptions** require manual intervention and lack on-chain auditability

### The Solution: Drip

Drip offers **programmable, real-time payment streams** and **recurring subscriptions** for stablecoins on the Celo network.

**Treasury teams define per-second rates or subscription cadences once** - the smart contract enforces distribution autonomously. Recipients can withdraw accrued balances instantly with on-chain proofs and full auditability.

### ✨ Key Features

#### 💸 Real-Time Payment Streaming
- **Per-second rate calculation** - Define payment rates that accrue continuously
- **Instant withdrawals** - Recipients can withdraw accrued balances at any time
- **Autonomous execution** - Smart contracts handle distribution automatically
- **Full transparency** - All transactions are on-chain and auditable

#### 🔄 Recurring Subscriptions
- **Flexible cadences** - Daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals
- **Automatic execution** - Payments process without manual intervention
- **Easy management** - Create, modify, or cancel subscriptions anytime
- **Payment history** - Complete on-chain record of all transactions

#### 📊 Treasury Management
- **Multi-token support** - Manage cUSD, USDC, USDT, and CELO
- **Bulk operations** - Create multiple streams/subscriptions at once
- **Analytics dashboard** - Track total outflow, active payments, and spending
- **Export functionality** - CSV/JSON export for reconciliation
- **Budget controls** - Set spending limits and monitor treasury health

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Create a Stream or Subscription**
   - Treasury manager connects wallet and selects recipients
   - Defines payment amount, duration (for streams), or cadence (for subscriptions)
   - Chooses stablecoin (cUSD, USDC, USDT)
   - Smart contract locks funds and begins distribution

2. **Autonomous Execution**
   - **Streams**: Balance accrues per second based on defined rate
   - **Subscriptions**: Payments execute automatically at specified intervals
   - All logic enforced by smart contracts - no manual intervention needed

3. **Recipient Withdrawal**
   - Recipients see real-time accrued balance
   - One-click withdrawal to their wallet
   - Instant settlement on Celo network

4. **Transparency & Auditability**
   - All transactions recorded on-chain
   - Complete payment history available
   - Export data for accounting and reconciliation

### 💼 Use Cases

- **Content Creators**: Stream payments to collaborators, editors, or team members
- **DAOs & Collectives**: Automate contributor payouts and recurring grants
- **Service Platforms**: Usage-based billing for API calls, compute, or storage
- **Payroll**: Automated salary payments with real-time streaming
